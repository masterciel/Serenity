## 1.3.1 (2014-10-14)

Bugfixes:

  - new item dialogs can open again (bug related to new async feature)
  - dialog fills page correctly when maximized (breaking change in jQuery UI 1.11)
  - make select editor non-abstract. required for enums to work

## 1.3.0 (2014-08-23)

Features:

  - add ability to define grid columns server side (just like form definitions)
  - extensible column formatter objects (string, number, enum, date etc.)
  - reduce number of attributes and repetitive code required in service endpoints (JsonFilter, Result<T>, etc) through new ServiceEndpoint base class.
  - new EnumKey attribute for enum types so same enum names in different namespaces doesn't get mixed
  - async versions versions of Q.GetLookup, Q.GetForm etc.
  - include promise library for async operations (make sure your LayoutHead.cshtml contains ~/Scripts/rsvp.js before jQuery)
  - widgets that do async initialization. TemplatedWidget, EntityDialog, DataGrid etc. supports this new system. 
    to provide backward compability, this feature is only enabled by adding IAsyncInit interface to a widget class.
  - allow criteria objects to be used on client side too (with some limitations to prevent SQL injections etc.)
  - list requests can now specify filtering through client side criteria
  - generate field names with entity classes in ServiceContracts.tt
  - merge ServiceContracts.tt and ServiceEndpoints.tt (refer to BasicApplication sample to update your own ServiceContracts.tt file)
  - upgrade to Saltarelle Compiler 2.6.0
  - upgrade to jQuery UI 1.11.1, jQuery Validation 1.13, FontAwesome 4.2, Bootstrap 3.2
  
Bugfixes:
  - enum editors use integer keys instead of string keys
  - fix slick grid column sort indicators in firefox
